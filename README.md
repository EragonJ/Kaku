# Setup Environment

Because we use npm to maintain our third party libraries, you have to make sure before doing anything, these needed stuffs are all installed already.

1. Use node 5.1.1
2. `npm i`
3. `npm i electron-prebuilt@0.36.0 -g` - Install **electron** command

**IMPORTANT NOTE :** If you are going to build Kaku for **Windows** build, you need to use the following command instead because some dependent modules need the flag to do some platform specific things.

```bash
NODE_PLATFORM=windows npm i
```

## Prerequistiques

**This is IMPORTANT, please read this**

Please take a look at `config/`, you will notice there are some files named like `api_config.*.json`, remember to update them with correct config and rename them to `api_config.production.json`, then everything should work as perfect !

In order to make sure others can join the development without worrying too much about this config, I just added `api_config.development.json` for you guys ! If you don't want to register these services by yourself and want to jump to develop directly, please just copy the file and rename to `api_config.production.json` then you are done !

## Make Production Build

We need to make sure all codes would be moved to the right place and generated the final entry point to reduce requests to load data, so you have to build first.

```bash
gulp build # without plaform argument, we will build Kaku based on your platform
```

or you can be more precise about which platform you are going to build like this :

```bash
gulp build --platform=mac # =linux32, =linux64, =windows, =win, =mac, =darwin are all valid
```

After that, you will get a solid application to run !

## How To Develop

### For Testers Who Want To Build Kaku And Give It A Try

This is for one-time tester, you can just directly build the clean Kaku and directly run
the code and see how it works.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### For Developers Who Need To Test Your Patches

You can use the command to create a daemon that would keep watching changes and rebuild
Kaku by webpack. After building, Kaku will be automatically reloaded and the changes would
be reflected on UI directly.

```bash
gulp watch
```

## How To Run Tests or Linter

For unit tests :

```bash
npm test
```

For linter :

```bash
gulp linter:all
```

## How To Update Translations

Because we use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/kaku/desktop-app/) to provide a cleaner and easy to use interface for translators, you need to install the command tool called [tx](http://docs.transifex.com/client/setup/) to update translations.

After installing, you don't need to setup anything else because they are all set up already under `.tx/config` ! You just need to use the command below to update translations !

```bash
tx pull -a --minimum-perc=90 # we only need any translation which has been translated > 90%
```
